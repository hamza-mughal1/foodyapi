# Foody - Food Vendor App Backend

## Foody is a modern food vendor app backend built using FastAPI with asynchronous capabilities. It aims to deliver advanced features like:

    Recommendation system
    Payment integration
    Restaurant management
    Rider management
    Notification system
    Event-driven architecture using Kafka
    Deployment using Kubernetes (K8s)
    Microservices architecture (future transition)

## Current Status

Foody is currently being developed as a monolithic application to ensure stability and streamlined development in the early stages. Once a stable version is achieved, the project will transition into a microservices architecture to enhance scalability and maintainability.

Stay tuned as we build this into a cutting-edge backend for a seamless food vendor platform! ðŸš€
